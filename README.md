Hate Speech Detection
This project finds out whether a given text message or comment contains hate speech or not using machine learning.
It is made using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Overview:
The model learns from example messages and then predicts if a new message is hateful or not.
It can help in detecting online abuse or toxic language.

Examples:

“I hate you because of your race.” → Hate Speech
“I respect everyone’s opinion.” → Not Hate Speech

Dataset

Source: Public hate speech dataset (add dataset name if known)

Labels:

hate → Message contains hate speech

not_hate → Normal or respectful message

Tools and Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Jupyter Notebook

Project Steps

Load the dataset

Clean the text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Convert text into numbers using TF-IDF

Train the model using machine learning (like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)

Check the accuracy and test it with new examples

Model Performance

Accuracy: around 95–98% (you can replace this with your result)

Works well in finding hateful and non-hateful messages

How to Run

Download or clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/mahathidarna/Hate-Speech-Detection.git

Open the file Hate Speech Detection_by_mahathi.ipynb

Run all cells one by one in Jupyter Notebook

Try your own text at the end to test predictions

Example Output
Text	Prediction
“I hate you!”	Hate Speech
“You are amazing!”	Not Hate Speech

Future Plans
Create a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit
Use deep learning (LSTM or BERT) for better accuracy
Add more data and charts for analysis
